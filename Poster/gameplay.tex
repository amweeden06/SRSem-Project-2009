The player uses the keyboard to move Bitty around and talk to other characters.  A Heads-Up Display (HUD) at the bottom of the screen allows the player to see current game statistics, save, load, and quit.  The gate and truth table corresponding to the current player task are also displayed on the HUD.
The player is assigned tasks by interacting with engineers.  Each engineer asks Bitty to return with a gate meeting certain specifications:  given certain inputs the gate should produce certain outputs.  To accept the task, the player must complete a truth table based on the engineer's description of the gate's specifications.  
To construct a gate, Bitty consults with a manufacturer, who is able to construct gates for which there are existing blueprints.  The manufacturer initially knows only how to build a NAND gate, but each time the player constructs a new blueprint the manufacturer is able to build a new gate, which the player can use in subsequent blueprints.  Thus, gates are constructed from other gates.
