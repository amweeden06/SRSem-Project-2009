{\textit{Computer City:  Sewers} hopes to teach the following skills and concepts:
Basic Gate Recognition (NAND, NOR, NOT, AND, OR, XOR)
Truth Table Construction
Abstraction -- Complex gates are built from collections of simpler gates
Information Hiding -- Lowers levels construct a framework but are unaware how the framework is used, and upper levels use the framework but are unaware how it is constructed.
