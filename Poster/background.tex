Since 2000, there has been a general decrease in enrollment and retention of students in computer science departments across the country \citep{Sung}, \citep{Wu}, \citep{Leutenegger}.  The diversity of participants in these departments has also been shown to decrease in upper-level courses, with fewer minorities and women participating in these classes \citep{Sung}, \citep{Wu}.  One of the more promising solutions to these problems is the incorporation of computer games into the computer science curriculum.  Games have been shown on multiple occasions to have a positive effect on motivation and engagement of students; and with the inclusion of educational components, they also provide increases in learning \citep{Wu}, \citep{deLaet}, \citep{Bayliss}, \citep{Wolz}, \citep{Flavor}, \citep{Belfore}.  With this in mind, the author of this poster has developed \textit{Computer City:  Sewers}, an educational game to teach digital logic, a fundamental topic in computer science.
