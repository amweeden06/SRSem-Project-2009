\textit{Computer City: Sewers} presents a hypothetical city as a metaphor for the computer architecture.  In such a city, every aspect of the computer architecture has a corresponding metaphor; buses in a computer correspond to the bus system of the city, addresses in computer memory correspond to the addresses of buildings in the city, and so forth.  The playable portion of the city is the sewer, conceptually the lowest level of the city, corresponding to digital logic, conceptually the lowest level of the computer hierarchy.  The player takes the role of Bitty, who has been placed underground by his/her superiors to assist the engineers who work in the sewers.  Engineers require logic gates to do their work, but they do not have the means to produce them and are not aware of the effects of their work.  The work done by the engineers affects the higher levels of the city, but these effects are hidden from the engineers and Bitty.  To provide gates for the engineers, Bitty consults with a manufacturer, who is able to produce gates if Bitty is able to construct blueprints for them.
