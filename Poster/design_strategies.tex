These strategies were obtained from research on the common design practices of educational computer game developers.  They include:
Game centered on the lesson -- The player should be unable to progress through the game without using the knowledge gained from the game's underlying lesson.
Clear connections to real-world applications -- Objects in the game should closely resemble their real-world counterparts, and the vocabulary of the game should closely match that of the real world.
Decision-making opportunities -- Giving the player choices encourages exploration, which increases both motivation and the amount of material learned.
Constant feedback -- When the player makes a decision, he/she should be aware of the results immediately.  In this way, the player is able to understand the connection between decisions and their consequences.
