According to studies conducted by Mirmotahari, Holmboe, and Kaasboll, there are typical struggles faced by students learning about boolean logic and gates.  In particular, they struggle with the relation between logic and gates.  They also struggle with the practical applications of boolean logic and gates.  Students also struggle with the assembly of gates to perform functions; their understanding of the application to functions and their parameters are not as easily grasped.  There is a general misunderstanding of the connections between low-level and high-level concepts.

"Computer City: Sewers" strives to alleviate these struggles.  The player of the game is shown the relation between gates and logic via the "truth tables" with which the player interacts.  Changing values in the truth table causes a direct change to the circuit in the room, so the player is able to receive instant feedback about the effect of changing a truth table on the circuit it represents.  In this way the player is able to understand the relationship between boolean logic and the gate model used to represent it.

After the first few rooms of the game, the player begins to observe more complex circuits that are used to produce the effect of functions.  The change in behavior of the room corresponds to these functions.
