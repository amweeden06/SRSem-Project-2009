Games are usually evaluated via a handful of methods.

How would I categorize the things that can be evaluated?

__Learning outcomes__
Live testers play the games to determine their playability.
Pre-tests and post-tests are often used, as in [LevelUp] and [ExperimentalEagle].
These pre-tests look to establish the experience and demographics of the testers [LevelUp and ExperimentalEagle].
Post-tests determine what the player has retained.

As [LevelUp] recommends, evaluation can also include keeping track of how much time a problem takes and how many tries the user needs to complete the problem.
This type of raw data can be graphed in order to analyze the speed and accuracy with with players complete the game [LevelUp].

The game can be divided by difficulty, and players can play subsets of the game and then other subsets [LevelUp].
This can help determine how to space and pace problems in the game.
Problems may not take as long to complete if other problems are encountered first, for example.

__Useability__
[Heuristic] provides a set of heuristics that can be used to evaluate the useability of a game.
