Intelligent Tutoring System

Too often a reward for learning

Level up system, built on Game2Learn system


Pre and post test evaluations are great, but not ideal.  We can also analyze game-log data.

Keep track of how much time is spent on a problem and the overall number of attempts.
Graph speed and accuracy and look for trends -- this is great!

Change the problem order, add new problems, change difficulty of problems.



So, it looks like the main points of this article are learning curves and data mining.


Questions I still have:
What is data mining in this context?  What is ITS?  Can I use them in my game?
Should I look into the STARS Alliance outreach program?
What has become of LevelUp?
