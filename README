Educational video games are a method of teaching that utilize the fun and immersive aspects of games and to motivate 
students to learn and explore topics that might otherwise be considered opaque and uninteresting.  There are a number of 
theories and design strategies on the development of educational games, particularly in the realm of computer science.  
For this project, I am developing a small puzzle game to teach boolean logic and gates that implements many of these 
theories and design strategies.  I will test the effectiveness of this game based on a play-testing session and surveys, 
as well as in-game data collection of such factors as time spent completing puzzles, number of attempts per puzzle, and so 
on.
