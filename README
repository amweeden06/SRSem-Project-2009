Educational video games are a method of teaching that utilizes the fun and immersive aspects of games to motivate students
to learn and explore topics that might otherwise be considered opaque and uninteresting. There are a number of theories 
and design strategies on the development of educational games, particularly in the realm of computer science. For this 
project, I am developing a small puzzle game that implements many of these theories and design strategies to teach boolean 
logic and gates. I will test the effectiveness of this game based on a play-testing session and surveys, as well as in-
game data collection of such factors as time spent completing puzzles, number of attempts per puzzle, and so on.
